  This was a plane wreck dive.
  The dive definitely was not as bad as my first night dive in the river with Phillip and Chuck.
  Mainly because there were so many people, you can see lights all over the place.
  Also, the water was clear and shallow enough that you could see the bottom from the surface.
  Finally, the boat, anchor, and back line all that glow sticks on it.
  We did a few loops around the crash site.
  Saw mini-stingrays, cow fish,

  One of the best dives ever.
  Saw a giant stingray, also saw 2 different types of tiger fish.
  We also saw a shark and some turtles.
  Ended up not sharing air with Aaron, we just started to head back when I was at 1000psi.
  I did end up having problems clearing my ear during the dive,
  I ended up surfacing and then slowly resurfacing.
  That's when I decided to stop video recording, but then that's when we spotted the turtle.
  The GoPro SD card failed on me during the turtle shot, sadly.
  Made it back to the boat while hovering around 15ft for the safety stop.

  Had a long dive because we were very shallow.
  Had some trouble with the current,
  I kept drifting into Aaron at times.
  Saw a puffer fish.
  Air consumption was much better this time.
  I ended at 1000psi and Aaron was at 1300psi.
  Right before heading back, we popped up to the surface,
  I must've took a wrong compass heading, or the current pushed us off course,
  by the time we surfaced we ended up on the starboard side of the boat,
  when I was aiming for the port.
  Poor visibility also meant that we could not see the morning line.

  Dove with a Hollis computer.
  All the weight problems from the previous dive were fixed.
  Also descended to about 10ft and swam to the morning line and met up with Aaron.
  He had some ear problems so we took it slow going down the morning line.
  We saw the lobster!
  I'm very aware of my first time doing videography,
  so I was constantly making sure Aaron was nearby.
  Even though both of us were using our GoPros, we were never really more than 10ft away from each other.
  I was going though my air much faster than he was, pretty much I was at 1000psi when he hit 1700psi.
  I eneded up buddy breathing off his octo, until he hit 1000psi before I went back to mine.
  We did a small swim while buddy breathing,
  and worked our way back when we both were at 1000psi.
  Found the group on the morning line where we did our safety stop.
  Saw a few of the sausages being deployed.
  I finished the safety stop right above 500psi,
  and we swam on the surface to our boat.

  Finally got off the docks!
  It was a 6-7 hour long bumpy ride to the dive site.
  I initially dove in with 9lbs on my BC.
  The morning line was against the current,
  By the time I made it to the morning line, I had used up a good chunk of my air,
  and was breathing heavily.
  I also found out I was not sinking, and had to add 4 more lbs.
  The initial group of people I planed to dive with broke off so I only dove with Julia.
  We checked our lights, all were working.
  This was the first time I was leading a dive, so I was very cognizant on where the boat was.
  I more or less, knew the general direction of the boat.
  I did ask other divers during the dive to check my direction of the boat.
  Also noticed the dive computer I was using was running low on batteries,
  aske Phillip at the end for a new computer.

    The bottom was extremely silty.
    The added belt weight from the night dive had my legs sinking and I hit the bottom.
    Kicked up a blinding ball of silt.
    We lost Philip, and had to resurface.
